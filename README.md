# Spartan-6-FPGA
Basic tutorial related to the Spartan 6 AX309 board. Implementation using ISE Design Suit

- `led_09/`  
  A simple LED project used to verify:
  - Pin constraints
  - Clock configuration
  - Basic Verilog/VHDL design flow
  - FPGA programming via JTAG

---

## 🔧 Development Environment

- **FPGA Device**: Xilinx Spartan-6  
- **Toolchain**:  
  - Xilinx ISE Design Suite (recommended for Spartan-6)
- **Language**:  
  - Verilog HDL (or VHDL, depending on the project)
- **Programming Interface**:  
  - JTAG

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install **Xilinx ISE Design Suite**
2. Create a new Spartan-6 project
3. Add HDL source files from this repository
4. Add the corresponding constraint file (`.ucf`)
5. Synthesize, implement, and generate bitstream
6. Program the FPGA via JTAG
